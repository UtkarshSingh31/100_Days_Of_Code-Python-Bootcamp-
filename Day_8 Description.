Day 8: Functions, Parameters, and Caesar Cipher

Key Concepts:- 

Functions: Reusable blocks of code that can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs.
Parameters: Values passed to functions that can be used within the function's code.
Caesar Cipher: A simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in a text by a fixed number of positions.

Project Overview:-

This project implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, allowing users to encrypt or decrypt messages.
Users can input the desired shift amount and choose whether to encode or decode the message.
The code includes functions for encryption and decryption, as well as a main loop for continuous usage.

Code Structure:- 

Import necessary modules: Import the logo module for visual display.
Define the alphabet: Create a list containing all the letters of the alphabet.
Define the encrypt function:
Takes the original text and shift amount as input.
Encrypts the text by shifting each letter by the specified amount.
Handles non-alphabetic characters.
Returns the encrypted text.
Define the decrypt function:
Calls the encrypt function with the same original text and a negative shift amount to decrypt.
Define the caesar function:
Takes the original text, shift amount, and encode/decode option as input.
Calls the appropriate encrypt or decrypt function based on the option.

Main loop:
Continuously prompts the user for input until they choose to quit.
Calls the caesar function with the user's input.
Prints the encrypted or decrypted result.
Asks the user if they want to continue.

Key Points:-

The encrypt and decrypt functions use the modulo operator to ensure that the shifted index stays within the range of the alphabet.
The code handles non-alphabetic characters by preserving them in the output.
The main loop allows users to perform multiple encryption/decryption operations.
The project demonstrates the use of functions, parameters, and basic string manipulation in Python.
