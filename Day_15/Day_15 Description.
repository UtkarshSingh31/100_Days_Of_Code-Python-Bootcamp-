# Coffee Machine

A Python-based console application that simulates a simple coffee machine. Users can order different types of coffee, and the machine will check resources, process payments, and dispense coffee accordingly. 

## How to Use

1. **Start the Machine**: Run the script in your terminal to start the coffee machine.
2. **Choose Your Drink**: Type `espresso`, `latte`, or `cappuccino` to order a coffee.
3. **Insert Coins**: Provide the required coins as input to pay for your drink.
4. **Receive Your Drink**: If the payment is sufficient and resources are available, the machine will dispense your coffee and provide any necessary change.
5. **Check Resources**: Type `report` to see the remaining resources in the machine.
6. **Turn Off the Machine**: Type `off` to stop the program.

## Features

- **Menu Options**: Choose from three different drinks: `espresso`, `latte`, and `cappuccino`.
- **Resource Management**: The machine keeps track of its water, milk, and coffee resources and checks availability before processing orders.
- **Coin Processing**: The machine calculates the total from the coins inserted and checks if the payment is sufficient.
- **Transaction Handling**: Provides change if necessary and refunds if the payment is insufficient.
- **Reporting**: Shows a report of current resources and profit when prompted.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
3. Run the script in your terminal:

    ```sh
    python coffee_machine.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the coffee machine.
