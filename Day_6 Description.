Day 6: Functions and Karel

Today, I delved into functions and their applications in Python, along with the Karel programming environment.

Functions
Defining functions: I learned how to create functions using the def keyword, giving them a name and potentially parameters.
Calling functions: I executed functions by calling their names with parentheses.
Built-in functions: I used the built-in len() function to determine the length of a string.
Karel

While loops: I implemented while loops to repeat actions until a condition is met.

Karel's world: I learned about Karel, a simple robot that can move around a grid and interact with objects.
Hurdle challenges: I used while loops to control Karel's movements and overcome hurdles of varying heights.
Escaping the maze: I applied my understanding of functions and loops to solve a maze-escaping challenge with Karel.


For more information and to access the Karel challenges, please refer to the link provided in my day's description.

By combining functions and loops, I can create more structured and reusable code. This will be valuable for building larger and more complex Python programs.
