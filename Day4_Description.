Day 4: Randomization and Lists
Today, I delved into random number generation and list data structures.

Randomization:- 
Importing the random module: I learned how to import the random module to access functions for generating random numbers.
Generating random integers and floats: I used random.randint() to generate random integers within a specified range and random.random() to generate random floats between 0 and 1.
Heads or Tails: I created a simple program to simulate flipping a coin using random.randint().

Lists
Creating and accessing lists: I learned how to create lists using square brackets and access elements by their index.
Negative indexing: I discovered that negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the list.
Checking list membership: I used the in keyword to check if an element exists in a list.
Nested lists: I created lists within lists to store more complex data structures.

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
I built a Rock, Paper, Scissors game:

Defined game images: I created a list of strings representing the images for rock, paper, and scissors.
Got user input: I prompted the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors by entering 0, 1, or 2.
Generated computer choice: I used random.randint() to randomly select the computer's choice.
Determined winner: I implemented logic to compare the user's choice with the computer's choice and determine the winner or if it's a draw.

Overall, I gained a better understanding of how to work with random numbers and lists in Python. This knowledge will be valuable for creating more dynamic and interactive programs.
