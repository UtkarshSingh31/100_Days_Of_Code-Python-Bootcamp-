# Higher or Lower Game

A simple Python console game where players guess which of two celebrities or public figures has more social media followers. The game continues until the player makes an incorrect guess.

## How to Play

1. **Compare Two Profiles**: The game displays two profiles (A and B), each representing a celebrity or public figure with a description, origin, and follower count.
2. **Make a Guess**: Type 'a' if you think profile A has more followers or 'b' if you think profile B has more.
3. **Score Points**: If your guess is correct, your score increases, and you proceed to the next round with a new profile.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends when you make an incorrect guess, and your final score is displayed.
5. **Play Again**: After the game ends, you have the option to play again or exit.

## Features

- **Randomized Profiles**: Profiles are randomly selected to ensure a unique experience every time you play.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score and see how many correct guesses you can make in a row.
- **Replay Option**: Choose to play again after the game ends for endless fun!
