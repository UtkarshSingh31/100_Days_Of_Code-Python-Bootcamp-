Day 1 Recap
Today I learned the basics of Python programming.

Printing to the console: I learned how to display text on the screen using the print() function.
String manipulation: I experimented with combining strings (text) using the + operator and discovered how to include new lines in the output.
Input and output: I explored how to get user input using the input() function and store it in variables.
Variables: I created variables to store different types of data, such as strings and numbers.
Basic arithmetic: I performed simple calculations and assignments with variables.
For my final project, I built a simple band name generator. The program asks the user for their city and pet name, then combines them to suggest a band name.

This was a great start to my Python learning journey!
