Day 5: Python Loops
Today, I delved into Python loops, which are essential for repetitive tasks.

For Loops
Iterating over sequences: I used for loops to iterate over lists, tuples, and strings, performing actions on each element.
Calculating statistics: I calculated the sum, maximum, and minimum values in a list of student scores.
Range function: I learned how to use the range() function to create a sequence of numbers for iteration.

FizzBuzz Program
Conditional logic: I implemented conditional statements to determine whether a number is divisible by 3, 5, or both.
Printing FizzBuzz: I printed "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5, and the number itself otherwise.


Password Generator Project
Random character selection: I used random selection to choose letters, symbols, and numbers from predefined lists.
User input: I allowed the user to specify the desired number of each character type.
Password creation: I created a password by concatenating the randomly selected characters.
Hard level: I added a feature to shuffle the characters in the password for added security.

Overall, I gained a solid understanding of for loops and their applications. I can now use them to automate repetitive tasks and create more complex programs.
