Project Description: Number Guessing Game

This Python code implements a number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game offers two difficulty levels: easy with 10 attempts and hard with 5 attempts.

Key Features:

Random number generation: A random number between 1 and 100 is generated for the player to guess.
Difficulty levels: Players can choose between easy and hard difficulty, affecting the number of attempts.
Guessing loop: The game continues until the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
Feedback: The player receives feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low.
Game over: When the player runs out of attempts, the game ends.
Replay option: The player is prompted to play again after each game.
How it Works:

Initialization: The game generates a random number and prompts the player to choose a difficulty level.
Guessing loop:
The player enters their guess.
The game compares the guess to the random number and provides feedback.
The number of attempts is decremented.
If the player guesses correctly, the game ends and the player wins.
If the player runs out of attempts, the game ends and the player loses.
Replay option: The player is asked if they want to play again. If yes, the game restarts with a new random number.
Overall, this code provides a simple and engaging number guessing game with adjustable difficulty levels.
