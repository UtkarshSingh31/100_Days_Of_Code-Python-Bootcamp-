Day 7: Hangman Game
Today, I built a classic Hangman game using Python.

Game Logic:- 

Random word selection: I chose a random word from a list of words.
Placeholder creation: I created a placeholder string with underscores to represent the hidden word.
User input: I prompted the user to guess a letter.
Letter checking: I checked if the guessed letter is in the word.
Updating display: If the letter is correct, I replaced the corresponding underscore with the letter.
Lives management: I kept track of the remaining lives. If the user guesses incorrectly, they lose a life.
Game over conditions: I determined if the game is over when the user runs out of lives or guesses the entire word.
Additional Features
Preventing duplicate guesses: I ensured that the user can't guess the same letter twice.
Displaying remaining lives: I displayed the number of lives remaining to the user.
Hangman art: I used ASCII art to visually represent the hangman as the user loses lives.
This project allowed me to practice using loops, conditionals, and string manipulation.

NOTE:- YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THE OTHERS MODULES(hangman_art.py,hangman_words.py) FROM GAME TO RUN.
